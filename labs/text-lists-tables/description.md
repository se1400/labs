# Text, Lists & Tables

In this lab, you'll enhance your Utah Tech University page with text formatting, lists, and tables. You'll practice using HTML tags for emphasis, special characters, different types of lists, and building data tables.

**Objective:** Follow the instructions below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.

## Part 1: Add a Google Font

Google Fonts lets you use custom typefaces on your web pages. You'll add the Montserrat font to make the main heading stand out.

**Step 1.** In the `<head>` section, after the existing `<link>` tag, add these three lines to load Montserrat from Google Fonts:

```html
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.googleapis.com">
<link rel="preconnect" href="https://fonts.gstatic.com" crossorigin>
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Montserrat:wght@700&display=swap" rel="stylesheet">
```

**Step 2.** In your CSS file, find the `h1` rule and add a `font-family` property. Set it to `'Montserrat', sans-serif` (the sans-serif is a fallback in case the font doesn't load).

---

## Part 2: Text Alignment

The `text-align` property controls horizontal text alignment. You can use values like `left`, `center`, `right`, or `justify`.

**Step 3.** In your CSS file, find the `header` rule and add `text-align: center` so the university name and tagline are centered.

## Part 3: Special Characters & Dynamic Year

HTML character entities display special symbols. They start with `&` and end with `;`. For example, `&copy;` displays the copyright symbol ©.

You'll also use JavaScript to automatically display the current year, so you never have to update it manually.

**Step 4.** In the footer, find the paragraph that says "Copyright Utah Tech University". You'll change it to show: © 2024 Utah Tech University (where 2024 is the current year, generated by JavaScript).

Do these three things:
- Change the word "Copyright" to the copyright symbol by typing `&copy;`
- After the copyright symbol, add a space and then a `<span>` element with `id="year"`
- Keep "Utah Tech University" after the span

Your paragraph should look like: `<p>&copy; <span id="year"></span> Utah Tech University</p>`

**Step 5.** Just before the closing `</body>` tag, add this JavaScript to fill in the current year:

```html
<script>
    document.getElementById('year').textContent = new Date().getFullYear();
</script>
```

## Part 4: Text Formatting Tags

HTML provides tags for emphasizing text with semantic meaning:
- `<strong>` makes text **bold** and indicates importance
- `<em>` makes text *italic* and indicates emphasis
- `<sup>` creates superscript text (like footnotes¹)
- `<pre>` preserves whitespace and line breaks exactly as written

**Step 6.** In the Welcome section, find the sentence "We are committed to active learning and helping students succeed." Wrap the words "active learning" in `<strong>` tags.

The result should be: `We are committed to <strong>active learning</strong> and helping students succeed.`

**Step 7.** In that same sentence, wrap the word "succeed" in `<em>` tags.

The result should be: `and helping students <em>succeed</em>.`

**Step 8.** Find "20:1 student-faculty ratio" and add a superscript footnote reference. Immediately after the word "ratio", add `<sup>1</sup>` to create a small raised "1".

The result should be: `20:1 student-faculty ratio<sup>1</sup>`

**Step 9.** In the footer, you'll use `<pre>` tags to format the address. Find the `<address>` element and wrap its contents in `<pre>` tags. Remove the `<br>` tag since `<pre>` preserves line breaks automatically.

Before:
```html
<address>
    225 S 700 E<br>
    St. George, UT 84770
</address>
```

After:
```html
<address>
<pre>225 S 700 E
St. George, UT 84770</pre>
</address>
```

**Important:** The text inside `<pre>` must start on the same line as the opening tag, and each line break in your code will appear as a line break on the page.

## Part 5: Unordered Lists

Unordered lists display items with bullet points. They use two tags:
- `<ul>` wraps the entire list (ul = unordered list)
- `<li>` wraps each list item (li = list item)

**Step 10.** Find the "Why Choose Utah Tech?" section and replace it entirely with a new section. Create a section with the heading "Our Colleges" and an unordered list containing these five colleges:

- College of Science, Engineering & Technology
- College of Health Sciences
- College of Humanities & Social Sciences
- College of Education
- College of the Arts

Your HTML structure should look like:
```html
<section class="panel">
    <h3>Our Colleges</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>College of Science, Engineering & Technology</li>
        <li>College of Health Sciences</li>
        <!-- ... and so on for each college -->
    </ul>
</section>
```

---

## Part 6: Nested Lists

You can nest lists inside list items to show hierarchy. This is useful for showing subcategories or details.

**Step 11.** Under the first college (College of Science, Engineering & Technology), add a nested unordered list. Place a new `<ul>` inside that `<li>`, after the college name, containing three programs:

- Computer Science
- Software Engineering
- Biology

Your structure should look like:
```html
<li>College of Science, Engineering & Technology
    <ul>
        <li>Computer Science</li>
        <li>Software Engineering</li>
        <li>Biology</li>
    </ul>
</li>
```

---

## Part 7: Ordered Lists

Ordered lists display numbered items automatically. They use:
- `<ol>` wraps the entire list (ol = ordered list)
- `<li>` wraps each list item (same as unordered lists)

**Step 12.** After the "Our Colleges" section, add a new section with the heading "How to Apply" and an ordered list containing these three steps:

1. Submit your application online
2. Send official transcripts
3. Complete the FAFSA for financial aid

## Part 8: HTML Tables

Tables organize data in rows and columns. Here are the key tags:
- `<table>` wraps the entire table
- `<thead>` contains the header row(s)
- `<tbody>` contains the data rows
- `<tr>` creates a table row
- `<th>` creates a header cell (bold and centered by default)
- `<td>` creates a data cell

**Step 13.** After the "How to Apply" section, add a new section with the heading "Tuition & Fees" containing a table.

First, create the basic table structure:

```html
<section class="panel">
    <h3>Tuition & Fees</h3>
    <table>
        <thead>
            <tr>
                <th>Program</th>
                <th>Resident</th>
                <th>Non-Resident</th>
            </tr>
        </thead>
        <tbody>
            <!-- Data rows will go here -->
        </tbody>
    </table>
</section>
```

**Step 14.** Inside the `<tbody>`, add three rows with tuition data. Each row needs three cells (`<td>`):

| Program | Resident | Non-Resident |
|---------|----------|--------------|
| Undergraduate | $227 | $725 |
| Graduate | $445 | $662 |
| Online | $260 | $260 |

---

## Part 9: Table Spanning

Sometimes you need cells that span multiple columns or rows:
- `colspan="n"` makes a cell span n columns horizontally
- `rowspan="n"` makes a cell span n rows vertically

**Step 15.** Add a title row that spans the entire table. In your `<thead>`, add a new `<tr>` **before** the existing header row. This new row should have one `<th>` cell with `colspan="3"` containing the text "Tuition Per Credit Hour".

Your thead should now look like:
```html
<thead>
    <tr>
        <th colspan="3">Tuition Per Credit Hour</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th>Program</th>
        <th>Resident</th>
        <th>Non-Resident</th>
    </tr>
</thead>
```

**Step 16.** Now you'll group the Undergraduate and Graduate rows together using `rowspan`. These are both "Campus" programs, so you'll merge their first cells.

Do these changes to your `<tbody>`:

a) In the Undergraduate row, change the first cell from "Undergraduate" to "Campus" and add `rowspan="2"`:
   `<td rowspan="2">Campus</td>`

b) In the Undergraduate row's Resident cell, add the label so it reads "Undergraduate: $227"

c) In the Graduate row, **remove the first `<td>` cell entirely** (it's now covered by the rowspan from above)

d) In the Graduate row's first remaining cell (which is now Resident), add the label so it reads "Graduate: $445"

Your final tbody should look like:
```html
<tbody>
    <tr>
        <td rowspan="2">Campus</td>
        <td>Undergraduate: $227</td>
        <td>$725</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Graduate: $445</td>
        <td>$662</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Online</td>
        <td>$260</td>
        <td>$260</td>
    </tr>
</tbody>
```
