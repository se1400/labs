# Build a Stylized To-Do List

In this lab, you will practice the different styles that can be applied to links when they are hovered over, focused, clicked, and visited.

**Objective:** Fulfill the user stories below and get all the tests to pass to complete the lab.

## User Stories:

1. You should have one unordered list with the class <code>todo-list</code>.

2. Inside the unordered list, you should have four list items.

3. Inside each list item, there should be:
   - An <code>input</code> element with the type <code>checkbox</code> and <code>id</code> set to a unique value.
   - A <code>label</code> element with the <code>for</code> attribute set to the corresponding <code>input</code> element's <code>id</code>.
   - An unordered list with the class <code>sub-item</code>.
   - A list item with an anchor element in it. The anchor should have the class <code>sub-item-link</code>, a valid <code>href</code> value, and a <code>target</code> value that makes the link open in a new tab.

4. Your <code>a</code> elements should not have any text decorations.

5. You should set the text color of unvisited links to a color of your choice.

6. When your links are visited, the color should change to another color of your choice.

7. When your links are hovered over, the color should change to another color of your choice.

8. When your links are focused, there should be a colored outline around the link.

9. When your links are clicked, the color should change to another color of your choice.

**Note:** Be sure to link your stylesheet in your HTML and apply your CSS.
